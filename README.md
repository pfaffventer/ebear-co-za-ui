#The eBear adventure

My journey into the big bad world of web technology starts here!

After 10 years working as an architectural draughtsman and 18 years off in-house ERP software integration development, I find myself lost between software languages and tools.

###NOTE:
My goal is to re-group, re-skill, become productive through deploying eloquent web based distributed systems using proven development processes and design patterns.

#Method or madness?

Over the years, I have spent a lot of time thinking about design principals and patterns related to in-house ERP automation and integration software development, the ones which stuck include ACID (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID) and OOP (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming).

Venturing into the world of web and mobile technology, I played around with more than a few modern web frameworks and needless to say I am overwhelmed. For the eBear journey I will focus on mainstream technologies, utilizing my Java experience to implement restful web services using spring.io and developing user interfaces in angular 2. 

For now I will try to study and understand the design patterns and principals implemented by the developers of my chosen stack. It seems that inversion of control, the separation of concerns and modular service oriented architecture works well to ensure clean, testable code for meaningful, productive development projects.

As far as project management is concerned, itâ€™s only me at this stage; I will however use Phabricator (https://www.phacility.com) to list and schedule tasks, trying to pick up on agile methodologies as I go along.

#The plan

The eBear project is intended to be a playground for exploring my chosen front end framework, angular.io, staring small with a static website containing 5 pages;

  - Home
  - About
  - Blog post x2
  - Contact

then grow the site into a modular angular 2 app with a restful web service back-end connected to a MySql database.
